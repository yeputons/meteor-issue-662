meteor-issue-662
================

Demonstration for Meteor's issue #662 (meteor/meteor#662). Run 'meteor' first, open the website, check out fancy fonts of two blocks.
Run 'meteor --production' then, check out that one of blocks now contains standard font.

File `extra.css` is not required for bug, you can freely remove it.
